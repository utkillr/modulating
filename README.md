###double_confuse##
main(num, iterates) tests code with number "num" and "iterates" repeatings  
Idea is that double numbers are not quite correct. And, for instance, sqrt(sqrt(...60 times)...)) of any number gives 1.0  
This code implements such number, that always gives right answer with little error on next function:  
F(x) = x = ((...(sqrt(sqrt(...(sqrt(x))...)))^2)...)^2)^2)
